# Full Stack Wish List
This is a full stack CRUD app designed around providing the optimal wish list experience. Our MVP consisted of making a simple front-end wish list, but we expanded it with authentication and connection to a MongoDB database for a more accessible approach.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, MongoDB, Passport.js (local Strategy), Mongoose, sessions, and MVP architecture

Using MVP architecture at the foundation of this project, our team was able to utilize Agile methodologies to create the most optimal work environment. We decided to use Mongoose as our ODM for mongoDB and collaborated on what data would be required to keep the database clean and organized for future iterations of the web app. We made sure that security was at the heart of this project by using bcrypt to protect passwords.  

## Optimizations

Had time permitted us to go a little bit deeper, we would have enjoyed making wish lists generate a sharable link for friends and family. We would like to create a private wish list that allows you to track your savings for the items on your list. Right now the front end is built with EJS, CSS, and JS, but we would really like to use a framework like React going forward. 

## Lessons Learned:

Learning how to work with a new team on such short notice was challenging at first. We all brought different strengths to the table and we learned how to pull those strengths out of each other. We were able to communicate through weird schedules by making use of the "issues" tab on github and having daily stand-up meetings to make sure that we were all on the same page.
